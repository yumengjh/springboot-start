# Deployment guide

## Production checklist

- Run Java 21 and the `postgres` profile. PostgreSQL must be reachable using `DB_URL`,
  `DB_USERNAME`, and `DB_PASSWORD`; use a least-privilege application role and supported
  TLS settings for the environment.
- Supply the initial administrator variables only when bootstrap is required. Rotate or
  remove the bootstrap secret after successful creation according to the secret
  manager's policy.
- Mount RSA signing material from a secret manager or secret file. Never bake private
  keys, database passwords, tokens, or a populated `.env` into the image.
- Configure exact CORS origins. Do not use a wildcard with credentialed browser
  requests.
- Keep forwarded-header handling disabled unless trusted proxy CIDRs are explicitly
  configured. The immediate sender must be trusted before `Forwarded` or
  `X-Forwarded-For` is considered; test the complete load-balancer/proxy chain.
- Decide whether Swagger UI should be exposed. OpenAPI/Swagger exposure is configurable
  in production; protect or disable it according to policy.
- Ensure the runtime identity is non-root and can write only required paths. SQLite
  storage is `/app/data` in the image, but PostgreSQL deployments should not depend on
  container filesystem persistence.

The exact property-to-environment bindings for JWT, trusted proxies, CORS, and Swagger
must come from the implemented configuration and `.env.example`; the design does not
define names for them, so deployment manifests should not invent aliases.

## Health probes

Use the public actuator groups, not sensitive actuator endpoints:

```text
Liveness:  GET /actuator/health/liveness
Readiness: GET /actuator/health/readiness
```

Liveness answers whether the process should be restarted. Readiness gates traffic and
should fail while required dependencies or startup work are unavailable. Set initial
delays/timeouts for the platform and migration duration; avoid restart loops during a
legitimate Liquibase rollout. `/api/v1/system/info` exposes non-sensitive build version,
Git commit, and build time where available (`null`, not fabricated values, otherwise).

## PostgreSQL backup and recovery

Before schema rollout, take a provider snapshot or a consistent `pg_dump` using an
appropriately privileged backup identity. Encrypt backups, restrict access, define
retention, and monitor success. A backup is not proven until a restore test succeeds in
an isolated database with application smoke tests.

Keep database recovery point/time objectives explicit. Include roles/privileges and
required extensions in recovery runbooks, while storing backup credentials outside the
repository. Do not use `docker compose down --volumes` against data you need to retain.

## Liquibase rollout

Liquibase is the only schema-authoring mechanism; Hibernate runs with
`ddl-auto: validate`. Review generated SQL against the target PostgreSQL version and
take a backup before risky changes. Prefer backward-compatible expand/migrate/contract
changes:

1. Add nullable/new structures that old and new application versions tolerate.
2. Deploy code that reads/writes the new representation and migrate data in bounded,
   observable batches.
3. Remove old structures only after rollback windows and old replicas are gone.

Run one controlled migration actor or rely on Liquibase locking with deployment
timeouts that prevent multiple rollouts from racing. Never edit an already-applied
changeset; append a corrective changeset. If startup validation fails, stop traffic,
inspect Liquibase state and logs, and choose forward repair or database restore based on
the reviewed runbook—do not bypass validation.

## GHCR publishing

The image workflow runs for `main` pushes and `v*` tags, builds with BuildKit, scans
with Trivy, and publishes ref/semantic tags to GitHub Container Registry. Workflow
permissions are limited to repository read, package write, and the security-event scope
needed by scanning. Pull requests do not receive publishing credentials.

For consumers, pin a release by immutable digest rather than a mutable branch tag, then
promote the same digest across environments. Confirm the repository/package visibility
and grant the runtime only pull access. Critical unfixed vulnerabilities fail
publishing unless an explicitly reviewed, time-bounded allowlist documents the reason.

## Generic continuous delivery extension

Publishing an image is the built-in handoff; deploying it is intentionally outside
scope. Add a separate least-privilege environment workflow or external deployment
system that:

1. selects an approved GHCR digest;
2. obtains environment secrets through the platform secret manager;
3. runs a pre-deployment database backup and reviewed Liquibase strategy;
4. deploys through SSH, a webhook, Kubernetes, or a platform-specific API;
5. waits for readiness and runs authentication plus public-announcement smoke checks;
6. rolls back application traffic on failure while respecting database compatibility;
7. records approver, digest, migration version, and outcome.

Use protected environments and short-lived workload identity where available. Do not
put server credentials in pull-request workflows or repository variables visible to
untrusted code.

## Environment-dependent verification

Repository contract checks:

```bash
./mvnw clean verify
git grep -nE 'BEGIN (RSA |EC |OPENSSH )?PRIVATE KEY|password:[[:space:]]+[^$<{]' -- ':!docs/**' ':!.env.example' || true
```

Runtime checks require their dependencies:

```bash
docker compose config
docker compose up --build --wait
curl --fail http://localhost:8080/actuator/health/readiness
curl --fail http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs >/dev/null
```

Docker/Compose/Testcontainers results are environment-dependent. Report skipped checks
as such; do not describe them as passed based only on static configuration.
